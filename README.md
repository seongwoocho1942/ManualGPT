### DATA example 1

Q: 
I would like to ask a question about MANUAL GUIDE i of FANUC. How is the bottom size/angle determined for turning when [WIDTH] is specified?

A: 
The bottom size/angle is determined for turning when [WIDTH] is specified by the difference between the groove entry of the side face on the reference position side and the width of the groove bottom. The inclination angle of the side face on the reference position side is determined when [ANGLE] is specified. If no value is entered, it is considered as 0 for both.
